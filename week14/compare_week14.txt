### Problem & Solution ###
There are two major obstacles about adaptive thresholding (which I faced this week)

1. 

Q: How should I decrease or increase the threshold properly according to 
the parameters?(ex. "area", "ratio of edge to area", "gradient")

A: Firstly, I choose to set a standard threshold then use linear scale to decrease or 
increase the threshold. However, the area vary a lot so the linear scale might overly
affect the threshold. Therefore, I then use logarithmic scale which perform much better
than linear scale. 


formula related to "area": decrease_delta = log10(min(area(A),area(B))/min_possible_area) * lamda0  (lamda0 = 125)
formula related to "ratio of edge to area": increase_delta = L/min(area(A)^0.5,area(B)^0.5) * lamda1 (lamda1 = 5)
formula related to "gradient": increase_delta = 4*1.5^(min(avg_grad(A),avg_grad(B))/10) 
(min_possible_area = 30)

As for how to determine the constants in the formulas is the second obstacle I encountered

2.

Q: How should I set the constant properly? How should I change the constant according to the #k_mean?
(since the area might be lower if #k_mean increase or vice versa)

A: Firstly, I use simulation software to help me see how the relationship looks like under different
constants, and I pick a set of constant for #k_mean = 40.
(I would choose #k_mean = 40 is because of its low oversegmentation and low running time)

Then I notice that the constant of formula related to "area" might vary under different #k_mean,
so I also design a proper curve that can adjust the constant of formula related to "area" according
to different #k_mean
( curve function: 30 * 0.95^(0.5x - 25) )

### Report ###

we can see that in the file 40means_week14.jpg and 40means_week13, the small regions of the grass 
are merged into large regions better in week14 image.(less small regions)

Also the edges of the fences in the front part of the images is more clear in week14 image.

Although being improved, the adaptive thresholding method bring more variables to the segmentation and 
therefore require more testing for better set of these variables.
